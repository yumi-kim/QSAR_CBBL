# QSAR_CBBL

# This project provides choice and optimization of descriptors based on machine learning. 
# It also provides a QSAR model to predict the activity of compounds using optimized descriptors. 
# You will be able to use this framework to obtain a machine-learned QSAR model from your own data and to predict the activity of the new # compound you have proposed.
